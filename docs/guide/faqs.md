## Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the service SLA?
For <b>Loginservice</b> running on our public servers, we do not guarantee any specific service level other than our Best Efforts. We are happy to work with Enterprise customers who need a specific Service Level Agreement and can work out an agreement according to their requirements. We also provide an option for Enterprise customers to run Authservice on their own servers.

Having said that, our uptimes are typically better than the requirements of most SLAs. See our <a href="https://github.com/tooltwist/loginservice.io/wiki/Downtime-history" target="_blank">Downtime history</a> page for our downtime history over recent years.
