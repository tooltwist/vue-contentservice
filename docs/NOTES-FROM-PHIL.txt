We generate documentation using:

1. VuePress (https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide)
VuePress is the official Vue documentation tool, replacing Hexo.
VuePress is similar to Nuxt where server side generation is used to create a static, Single Page Application.
Being Vue based, the application's Vue components can be used in the documentation.
After generation the static HTML files can be deployed on any regular web server (e.g. S3 bucket with Cloudfront).

2. StyleGuidist (https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/docs/Documenting.html)
StyleGuidist generates component documentation by parsing comments in our *.vue component files.

3. The StyleGuidist comments are inserted into the Vuepress documentation. See https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/Examples.html#docgen for an example.
